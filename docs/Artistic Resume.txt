Artist Statement
My work explores the intersection of isolation and beauty in digital and natural landscapes.
Using acrylic on canvas, I create immersive scenes with symbolic elements—portals, reflections, moonlight—to evoke wonder and stillness. 
Inspired by sumi-e painting, I work with limited palettes and soft layers to build tension between negative space and detail.
